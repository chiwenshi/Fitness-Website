        <h5 class="card-title">Resistance Loop Exercise Bands</h5>
        <p class="card-text">While these resistance bands are often used for sports and fitness,
          physical therapists love these physical therapy bands (rehab bands) to help them rehabilitate their patients.
          They work for people suffering from leg, knee and back injuries and help in recovery from torn MCL and ACL,
          knee replacement, patella and meniscus rehab.
          They are also perfect for use by women after pregnancy and birth to keep their bodies in shape.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Training with dumbbells allows you to select resistance training
        exercises based on their similarity to actual movements that occurs during sports.
        Dumbbells require more balance than training with barbells or machines, and balance is crucial for optimal performance.
        Dumbbells also require more muscular control than barbells, thus enhancing kinesthetic awareness.</p>
